Techniques:
    semijoins
    judicious ordering
    chain joins
    Lagrangean multipliers
        linear optimization to determine optimal join
    
The standard technique involves a cascade of binary joins

Multi-way join
    requires solving nonlinear equations
        therefore, should not expect unique solutions
    
Star join
    fact table joined by dimension tables
    
Chain join
    most common solution
    general case solution is different for even and odd length chains
